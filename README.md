# Maximilian Ne√ülauer's Portfolio Website

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal portfolio website!
I created this site to showcase my projects and skills as a Computer Science student.
I used the opportunity to create this website to learn astro, react, typescript and tailwind CSS as i previously only had javascript, html and css experience.

The site is currently being hosted on Vercel.
Check it out here: <https://www.maxi-n.tech/>

- **Astro**: Used for efficient loading and optimal performance.
- **React**: Powers the interactive components such as the header.
